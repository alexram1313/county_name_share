# County Name Shares

In the United States, counties (or the county-equivalents: parishes and boroughs) are the direct subpolitical divisions of states. As a Southern California native, I noticed that many local counties and their county seats share the same name (e.g., Los Angeles County and Los Angeles) and I wondered how common a practice that is. Thus, with the help of ROOTS-L, this Python module reads and parses the text file then saves all name shares.
